# CIS-Computational-Intelligence-Integrated-Solver-for-Engineering-Optimisation
 
We are going to start this project using MATLAB/Python/C/(TBD):

To utilize a diverse range of CI approaches, the CIS has been developed. As shown
in Figure 5.4, the architecture of the CIS consists of three modules—the data input,the integrated solver and the result output, which can be described as follows:
•  Module 1: Data Input (point A). This module prepares the data input for the in-
tegrated solver. It collects, filters, stores and pre-processes data originating from various sources such as statistical yearbooks, research analyses and government reports.

•  Module 2: Integrated Solver. In this module, a set of nature-inspired computa-
tional approaches are integrated into one solver to optimize complex real-world
problems, which primarily involve one or more of the following methods: GAs,
simulated annealing (SA), artiﬁcial immune algorithms and quantum computa-
tion. In this chapter, the swarm dolphin algorithm (point C) is embedded in this
solver and the details of this algorithm.

•  Module 3: Result Output (point B). This module reports the ﬁnal results from
module 2 and conducts all post-‘Integrated Solver’ tasks such as result visualization and data storage, and can be utilized for applications, such as artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs) and fuzzy logic (FL).
